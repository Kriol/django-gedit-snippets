This is a snippet file with Django 1.x tags to be used with the Gedit Snippets plugin. Currently it includes:

* The 26 model field types
* Some snippets for common code patterns:
    * djmodel (model class)
    * djadmin (admin model class)
    * djredirect (redirect response)
    * djview (view function)
    * djsave (model save() override) 
    
Read the INSTALL file for installing instructions.
    
If you find errors or have suggestions for tags to be included in this snippet send me 
an email to marcelor at gmail.com or just create an issue ticket here in GitHub.

Thanks to Paolo Ferretti (http://www.paoloferretti.it) for the initial work!
